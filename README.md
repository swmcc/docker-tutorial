# Docker

I want to get myself more familiar with [docker](https://www.docker.com). In order to do this I am 
going through the [tutorials](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) on the offical site. I use docker in my day
to day job but want to know more, so this is more of a refesher as well
as learning new things.
